# XUnit.Observations
XUnit.Observations is intended to be a bolt-on augmentation for the XUnit testing framework, which was inspired by a sample they have in their sdk repo! Currently under development we intend to provide a method by which you can more easily structure your tests to minimize code duplication and optimize human-readability of the core intent of your test suites.
